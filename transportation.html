<p>
As of 2014, over 5,710 MTA Regional Bus Operations-operated buses carried about 2.5 million daily passengers 24/7 on more than 238 local routes, 62 express routes, and 7 Select Bus Service routes, amounting to 793 million annual bus trips. <br> 
    Buses owned by MTA account for 80% of the city's surface mass transit. <br>
    New York City has the largest clean-air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet in the United States. <br>
    Local bus routes are labeled with a number and a prefix identifying the primary borough (B for Brooklyn, Bx for the Bronx, M for Manhattan, Q for Queens, and S for Staten Island). <br> 
    Express bus routes operated under MTA New York City Bus use the letter X rather than a borough label. <br>
    Express bus routes operated under MTA Bus (formerly controlled by the NYC Department of Transportation) use a two-borough system with an M at the end (i.e., BM, BxM, SIM, or QM). <br> Additionally, MTA offers precise bus arrival time using QR code located at each stop. Some stops also have digital panels indicating arrival times.

<p>
Taxicabs are operated by private companies and licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. <br>
    "Medallion taxis", the familiar yellow cabs, are historically the only vehicles in the city permitted to pick up passengers in response to a street hail. <br>
    In 2013, a new type of street hailed livery vehicles called "boro taxis" in "apple green" color are permitted to pick up passengers in the outer boroughs and the northern part of Manhattan. <br>
    A cabâ€™s availability is indicated by the light on the top of the car. When the light is lit, the cab is empty and available; when it is not lit, the cab is unavailable.

<p>
The New York City Subway is the largest subway system in the world when measured by number of stations (472),and the eighth-largest when measured by annual ridership (1.76 billion passenger trips in 2015). <br>
    It is the second-oldest subway system in the United States after the rapid transit system in Boston. <br>
    In 2002, an average 4.8 million passengers used the subway each weekday. <br> 
    During one day in September 2005, 7.5 million daily riders set a record for ridership. <br>
    In 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides,[35] averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays, about 3.2 million rides on Saturdays, and about 2.6 million rides on Sundays. <br> 
    Ridership has been consistently increasing over the last several years, especially because of rising gas prices and the subway's energy efficiency. <br>
    Life in New York City is so dependent on the subway that the city is home to three of only five 24-hour subway systems in the USA. <br>
    The city's 28 subway services run through all boroughs except Staten Island, which is served 24/7 by the Staten Island Railway.
